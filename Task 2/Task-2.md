->First I started numpy tutorial which was quite good and i had all my basics clear. 
->Then I started with pandas tutorial which was quite useful.
->Then i started matplotlib tutorials. Here i learned a lot of new things from how to plot histograms,bar charts,stack plots,etc...
->Then i started sklearn . I implemented basic ml models like linear regression ,logistic regression,svm,random forests.
->Then I started OpenCV which was quite interesting and fun. One time I spent hours figuring what the problem with the code is and then I took help of my fellow taskphase members. 
->Currently I am doing deep learning specialization and i have completed course 1 of the specialization and looking forward to learn more.
