->In the coursera course of python by google i have learned basics of python like(loops,conditional statements and various data types,etc..)

->For the first mini project i had selected my own game which was space invader because i felt it was interesting than the rest and i had taken help from youtube and i used pygame library to build the game.
->For the second mini project i had selected snake game which was fun ,although the results were not as expected i still loved the game and i used pygame library to build the game.
